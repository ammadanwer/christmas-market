**Introduction**

The [Bath Christmas Market](https://bathchristmasmarket.co.uk) is a yearly extravaganza, where the city of Bath is 
transformed into a veritable Winter Wonterland, with a selection of gift chalets for all your Christmas purchasing 
requirements. Or so they would have you believe ;) For me, long in the tooth and a little bit grumpy, it looks just like 
a log jam. People shuffling in between chalets with their Christmas spirit disappearing faster than the mince pies 
and hot toddy.
 
On the plus side, it has given me a great excuse to gain more knowledge of the Neo4j Graph Database and its out of the
box capabilities.
 
**Use Cases**

1. Optimum Route: Given a set of chalets to visit, define an optimum travel route between the chalets such that each of 
the set is visited at least once.
 
2. Visualize Route: Given the optimum route, provide a user friendly visual of the route.
