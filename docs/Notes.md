##Introduction

The [Bath Christmas Market](https://bathchristmasmarket.co.uk) is a yearly extravaganza, where the city of Bath is 
transformed into a veritable Winter Wonterland with a selection of gift chalets for all your Christmas purchasing 
requirements. Or so they would have you believe. For me, long in the tooth and a little bit grumpy, it's a bit of a log  
jam. People shuffling between chalets with their Christmas spirit disappearing faster than the mince pies 
and hot toddy. When it comes to Christmas shopping, high focus efficiency is what is required! 

This project uses the Neo4j Graph Database to determine the optimum route through the christmas market, given 
a set of chalets to purchase from. It gives a user friendly visual of the route, using Neo4j Desktop, making use of 
virtual nodes and relationships.
 
**Use Cases**

1. Optimum Route: Given a set of chalets to visit, define an optimum travel route between the chalets such that each of 
the set is visited at least once.
 
2. Visualize Route: Given the optimum route, provide a user friendly visual of the route.
