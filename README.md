# Christmas Market

The project is based on the [Bath Christmas Market 2018](https://bathchristmasmarket.co.uk). It looks at the following use cases:

1) Given a set of chalets to visit, define an optimum travel route between the chalets such that each of the set is
visited at least once.

2) Given the optimum travel route, provide a user friendly visual of the route.

The project is written against the Neo4j graph database, using Cypher and APOC.
