# Christmas Market

This mini project was based on the Bath Christmas Market 2018. It defines a subset of chalets and a contrived set of 
costs that define how expensive it is to move between chalets. The project at these use cases:

1) Given a set of chalets to visit, define an optimum travel route between the chalets such that each of the set is 
visited at least once.

2) Given the optimum travel route, provide a user friendly visual of the route.

The project is written against the Neo4j graph database, using Cypher and APOC.
